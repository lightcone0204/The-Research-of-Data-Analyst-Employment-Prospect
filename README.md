# The Research of Data Analyst Employment Prospect
 
Hello, here is the project that my partner and I completed for ECON7035 Artificial Intelligence for Business during the MSc in Data Analytics & Business Economics program at Hong Kong Baptist university.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to provide data analysis students with advice when looking for a job.

We have established a regression model on wages by obtaining the recruitment information of all data analyst positions on the recruitment website. Then we use this regression model to predict the salary that the campus recruitment position may receive in the next few years, and combine the predicted salary and the local salary level to calculate the recommendation coefficient of each piece of campus recruitment information. This recommendation coefficient represents the corresponding campus recruitment position. Potential for wage growth. 

Finally, use the recommendation coefficient as a basis for intelligent recommendation of recruitment information.
